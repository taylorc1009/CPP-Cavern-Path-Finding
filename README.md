# Cavern Path Finding
An Artificial Intelligence project given by Edinburgh Napier University to find a pathway through a cavern with N amount paths.

This application utilizes the A* search algorithm to find the best possible path through a series of caverns, each of which have their own (x, y) coordinates.

The Makefile will help you use the application, and its commands are:
* `compile` compiles the application using the Windows C/C++ compiler,
* `clean` removes any files from the directory that were generated by the compiler or the appllication,
* `navigate cav=generatedX-X` executes the application using the Batch file with a caverns file (.cav file name to search from /cavs) as a parameter.

Final execution time of navigating 5000 caverns (of course, lower PC specs may give a different result):

## Here's some information I was given in the coursework specification:
* .cav files are text files which contain a series of integers, separated by commas.
* The first integer gives the number of caverns - N.
* The next N*2 integers give the coordinates of each of the caverns ï¿½ each value is non-negative.
* The final N*N integers give the connectivity of the tunnels. 1 means connected, 0 means not connected. Remember that some tunnels are one-way.
* You must always start at the first cavern in the input file and end at the last cavern in the input file, where a route has been found. The first number will always be 1 and the last number will always be the ID of the last cavern.
* The solution program can be written in a language of your choice, but it must run on the command line and be accessible by the .bat file.

### Solutions I was given to some of the .cav files prior to starting the project:
